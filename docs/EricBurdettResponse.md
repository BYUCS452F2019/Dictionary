# Project Pitch Response - Dictionary
_Eric Burdett_

## Introduction

I really like this project idea because it focuses on the data and the underlying system to manage the data (we are in a database modeling concepts class after all...). Most of the projects posted involve a database; however, I feel that a large portion of the work has nothing to do with a database. I'm excited for this project because I think it will allow us to focus on the principles discussed in this class, rather than such a large emphasis on the front-end.

In fact, I think this project could present some very interesting problems that will be fun to model with a database. For example, the sheer amount of data that would need to be stored in the database could prove to be difficult, especially when you add support for multiple languages. I would also assume that in some languages, there is not a perfect translation from word to word. This could cause us to add support for "related words" and model our data in a graph database, which could be fun. The same could also be said if we wanted to add support for synonyms. Regardless of the decisions we make, I think this is a great project that allows us to focus on database modeling concepts.

## Experience/Aspirations

I'm very familiar with relational databases and have had some great industry experience with Postgres and SQL Server, and I'm pretty well-versed with SQL. I have not done as much with NoSQL databases (besides a small project that utilized Google Firebase), so I would love to dive into different NoSQL implementations. I'm also really interested in handling big data and trying to get better performance. Overall, I'm willing to help out with all aspects of this project and produce a great product.

## Considerations

### Business

As for the business model, I think you're on the right track. Keeping it free on a consumer-level will definitely allow us to produce the best dictionary that is as thorough as possible. If it becomes popular enough, I could definitely see other products wanting to utilize it and bring in profit through that medium.

### Legal

Not much to comment on here. 

### Technical

The technical priorities also feel appropriate. We may want to define exactly what the requirements are for this software product and clearly state the feature-set.

## Conclusion

Overall, this seems like a great project that would help us learn about database modeling concepts. I would love to work on this and help out in any way that I can.
