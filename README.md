# Dictionary
Create a Multilingual Dictionary
Project description
We will create a multilingual dictionary where users can add word translations to a dictionary and thereby create an open source multilingual dictionary.
Team
I think 1-2 others would be good. So, a team of 2-3 people.
SQL
I would think MySQL would be a good one to use.
No-SQL
I would guess that key-value pairs would be the best No-SQL but open for discussion
Business
We want as many users to participate as possible to create the best possible dictionary.  Therefore, it will be free to use on a consumer level.  There will be some charge for companies to integrate into their products.
Legal
The business will be a Utah LLC.
Technical
Our priorities will be:
1.	Choose the languages we are going to include initially
2.	Choose an initial SQL database for a prototype
3.	Choose necessary programming languages
4.	Implement the dictionary
